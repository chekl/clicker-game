# Clicker Game
It is a simple clicker game.

# Technologies
The game is written using only JS, CSS, and HTML. Webpack was used for modules.

# About
It has a registration form to collect the user's name and email address. It has a basic validation for the completeness of the fields and the correctness of the email address. RegEx was used.

The game has 5 levels, and the player is able to progress to the next level by reaching a target number of clicks for each.

Each level has a different enemy and theme.

The game keeps track of the player's score (the total number of clicks they have made across all levels). The score is displayed on the screen at all times.

Each game level has an enemy that the player can click to earn points and damage it.

When the player reaches the target number of clicks for a level, a message is displayed on the screen congratulating them on reaching the next level.
